# Scenario 3

There is n targets located in a one-dimension space,
we assume that the user has a specific location for each target in mind;
the artificial assistant choose the placement of the targets. 
The user provides a noisy binary feedback (yes/no), 
reflecting to which extent he is satisfied. 

Note that everything is "abstract" (i.e. there is no GUI).
