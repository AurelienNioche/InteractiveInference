# Scenario 2

There is n targets located in a one-dimension space, 
we assume that the user wants to get one closer 
(user is located at 0);
the artificial assistant choose which target to move closer, 
which also move all the other targets away to the user.
The user provides a noisy binary feedback (yes/no), 
reflecting to which extent he is satisfied. 

Note that everything is "abstract" (i.e. there is no GUI).
